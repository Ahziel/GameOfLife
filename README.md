## Description

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by the cambridge mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. Even though it is called “Game of Life”, this program is NOT A GAME but only an automaton. The behaviour of the program is determined by the initial state of the system/grid and a set of rules.
